# brickBreaker
Brick Breaker game in JavaScript with no external libraries. Code is based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

Some minor modifications have been made. I do not claim this to be my original work. This repo exists simply to play and understand basic game programming in my relentless quest to quench my thirst for coding know-how :)
