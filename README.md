# brickBreaker
Brick Breaker game in JavaScript with no external libraries. Code is based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

Some minor modifications have been made. I do not claim this to be my original work. This repo exists simply to document my first 'game understanding' that I have fully understood and then proceeded to code, debug and make minor tweaks and still be able to run this game in the end.
